## InterPlanetary Shock Recognition Networks
This repository contains a tool based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the identification and classification of interplanetary shock waves in solar wind time series

Space weather disturbances have the potential to cause significant disruptions to communication systems, power distribution, equipment, and satellite reliability. Within the interplanetary medium, specific magnetic structures, including interplanetary coronal mass ejections, and co-rotating interaction regions can propagate at velocities exceeding that of the solar wind. As a consequence, shock waves form in the interplanetary medium. This study employs artificial neural networks (ANNs) to detect interplanetary shocks using time series datasets derived from various parameters of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). These datasets are transformed into graphs for image analysis and implementation within the neural network framework. The approach using convolutional neural networks (CNN) has significantly advanced the accuracy in detecting interplanetary shock waves structures, achieving an average detection rate of 91\%. This applies consistently across different patterns of time windows, as observed by satellites positioned at the point L1.
